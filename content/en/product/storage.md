Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

Blob storage is ideal for:

- Storing large datasets from experiments
- Archiving research data
- Sharing data with collaborators
- Managing data from IoT devices in field experiments

The Federal Science DataHub (FSDH) provides a secure and reliable storage solution for you to store and share your data. It also provides a user-friendly interface to manage your data.

## Sample use case

- **Health Canada:** A team of researchers at Health Canada is using the FSDH to store chromatograms from their experiments. The FSDH allows them to easily upload and organize their data. It also connects to their analysis tools for further processing.
