Azure PostgreSQL is a fully managed relational database service based on the popular open-source PostgreSQL database engine. It provides high availability, scalability, and security for your data. Azure PostgreSQL is ideal for storing structured data and running transactional workloads.

PostgreSQL is ideal for:

- Storing structured data
- Running transactional workloads
- Building applications that require relational databases
- Managing data for web applications

The Federal Science DataHub (FSDH) allows you to provision Azure PostgreSQL for your research, enabling researchers to store and manage their data in a secure and scalable environment.

## Sample use cases

- **Environment and Climate Change Canada:** Researchers at Environment and Climate Change Canada are using Azure PostgreSQL to store data about air pollution mixtures relevant to Canadians living in urban areas. The FSDH provides them with a secure and scalable environment to manage their data and run queries for analysis.
