Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. It provides a rich set of features for developing web applications in a variety of programming languages using Docker containers. Azure App Service on the Federal Science DataHub (FSDH) is ideal for hosting basic web applications or APIs for internal use.

Azure App Service is ideal for:

- Hosting web applications
- Building APIs
- Deploying containerized applications
- Scaling web applications

The FSDH allows you to provision Azure App Service for your applications. These apps are accessible to other researchers within the workspace.

## Sample use cases

- **Health Canada:** A team of researchers at Health Canada is using Azure App Service with the FSDH to host a web application that enables them to share data, results, and dynamic visualizations with collaborators in several departments. The FSDH provides them with a secure and scalable environment to host their application.
- **Department of Fisheries and Oceans:** A team of researchers at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is using Azure App Service to host an API that provides information about marine protected areas and their environmental conditions, as well as climatology data over time. The FSDH allows them to easily deploy and scale their API to meet the needs of their users.
- The FSDH also provides some demo applications for several frameworks. You can view this demos [on our GitHub organization](https://github.com/ssc-sp)
