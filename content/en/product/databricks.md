Azure Databricks is a cloud-based big data analytics platform. It provides a collaborative environment for data scientists, data engineers, and business analysts to work together on big data projects. Azure Databricks on the Federal Science DataHub (FSDH) combines the power of Apache Spark with a collaborative notebook interface, making it easy to build and deploy data pipelines, machine learning models, and analytics applications.

Azure Databricks is ideal for:

- Processing large datasets
- Building machine learning models
- Running interactive queries
- Collaborating on data projects

The FSDH allows you to provision Azure Databricks for your research, enabling researchers to conduct analysis of their data at a large scale.

## Visual Studio Code Extension

Using the Databricks Visual Studio Code extension, you can connect to a Databricks workspace from within Visual Studio Code. This allows you to:

* Write your code locally in Visual Studio Code and run it remotely on a Databricks cluster to leverage cloud computing.
* Run SQL queries on a Databricks cluster and see the results locally in Visual Studio Code.
* Manage your Databricks clusters.

## Google APIs and Services

Use Google APIs on Databricks to run tools only available on Google Cloud, such as Big Query or Earth Engine, extending what you can do on the FSDH.

## Sample use cases

- **Environment and Climate Change Canada:** A team of researchers at Environment and Climate Change Canada is using Azure Databricks to analyze climate data and automatically build dashboards for monitoring trends in PowerBI. The FSDH provides them with a secure and scalable environment to process their data.
- **Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada:** Data scientists at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada are using Azure Databricks to house a database for pathogen present in Canada. They are now able to build dashboards from their data and have future options to build machine learning models on the data.
