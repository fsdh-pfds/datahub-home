The Federal Science DataHub provides a number of external integrations to help researchers work with their data. These integrations make it easy to use popular tools and services with the FSDH.

## Git integration

The FSDH allows you to connect your Git repositories with your workspace. This integration works with GitHub, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, and GitLab. This allows you to use your preferred version control system with the FSDH.

You can also choose to share publicly available Git repositories with other researchers on the FSDH. This makes it easy to collaborate on code and data with your colleagues across the government.

## GC Open Data Portal

The FSDH allows its users to connect to the Government of Canada Open Data Portal to publicly share their data. This allows collaboration with external partners and ensures transparency into your data. This also fulfills requirements for publishing with some academic journals or other institutional requirements.

## Bring your own storage

You may have existing data stored in cloud storage services. The FSDH allows you to connect your own storage accounts with your workspace. This integration works with Azure Blob Storage, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage.

## Data visualization

The FSDH integrates with popular data visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau. This allows you to create interactive dashboards and reports from your data in the FSDH.
