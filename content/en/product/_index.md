Influenced by the federal science community from ​day one, the Federal Science DataHub (FSDH), a powerful and secure cloud-based enterprise data solution that revolutionizes data storage, analysis and collaboration.

As a GC-approved platform that is preconfigured for cross-departmental collaboration, the FSDH is ready to fuel discoveries and accelerate GC science. It is a space where you can focus on your science, while we do the rest. 

The FSDH empowers knowledge sharing and collaboration with scientists and researchers across departments and across the country able to work together in one platform. It offers:

<ul class="list-disc mb-300">
    <li> world-class data infrastructure and tools; </li>
    <li> dynamic sharing and collaboration capabilities to reduce silos across the Government of Canada (GC) science community;   </li>
    <li> advanced compute, machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline work and tackle complex challenges;  </li>
    <li> customized, scalable cloud storage to optimize cost effectiveness; and </li>
    <li> IT autonomy in a secure environment. </li>
</ul>

The FSDH can currently only be used for unclassified data. Accommodating data and information up to Protected B is on our 2025-26 roadmap.

## Who uses the FSDH?

The FSDH is tailored for science-based departments and agencies (SBDAs) who require data storage, analysis and collaboration tools. Over the course of two proofs of concept, more than 600 scientists at over 15 SBDAs have experimented with the platform and provided feedback along the way.  

## Benefits of the FSDH

The FSDH is an enterprise solution for data storage, analysis and collaboration that enables scientists to focus on the science, while we do the rest. When you use the FSDH, you:
