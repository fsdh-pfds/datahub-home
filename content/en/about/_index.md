Shared Services Canada (SSC) created the Science Program (SP) to support Government of Canada (GC) priorities around modernizing and securing research in Canada and to better enable the GC scientific community with the digital infrastructure and services required to support their respective mandates. The SP originally consisted of five work streams. One of them, Data Solutions, was focused on building an enterprise data solution for science-based departments and agencies (SBDAs) that addresses common data challenges and strengthens the posture of federal science in Canada. This solution would become the Federal Science DataHub (FSDH).

Development of the FSDH is grounded in the guiding principles of enterprise:

<ul class="list-disc mb-300">
    <li>Co-design and implement enterprise data solutions with SBDAs for SBDAs; </li>
    <li>Eliminate ongoing investment of financial and human resources in the development of siloed solutions that address similar challenges; </li>
    <li>Enable scientific discovery and analysis in an autonomous and secure environment; </li>
    <li>Remove barriers that inhibit collaboration between SBDAs (and external stakeholders); and </li>
    <li>Plan continuously and adaptively to allow for evolution based on SBDA feedback and technology insights/advances. </li>
</ul>

## Scientists and researchers influencing the solution every step of the way.

Coming together monthly as the Data Solutions for Science Working Group (DSSWG), approximately 40 people from 16 SBDAs deliberated and agreed upon the mandate, objectives, priority areas and features of the first iteration of what is now the Federal Science DataHub (FSDH).

Two proofs of concept (PoC) over the course of two years have ensured the needs of SBDAs remained at the forefront of development and evolution.

<ul class="list-disc mb-300">
    <li>Bring your own storage (AWS/Azure/GCP) </li>
    <li>Web app hosting (Azure App Service) </li>
    <li>Managed databases (PostgreSQL) </li>
    <li>Workspace + tool deletion </li>
    <li>Publishing to the Open Data Portal </li>
    <li>Improved support request system (allowing users to track their requests in-portal) </li>
</ul>

An innovation roadmap, based on feedback from users, has further identified and prioritized features and functionality important for future iterations of the FSDH.
